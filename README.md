# Work_Day_Scheduler

## A simple, one page, day scheduler

The task was to create a single page, simple task manager app using starter code. The current day of the week and date is displayed at the top of the page using Moment.js. The day is broken down into 1 hour time slots starting at 9am and running up to 5pm. The past time-slots are grey in colour, the current time-slot is red and future time-slots are green. The blocks are coloured on refresh using Moment.js to retrieve the current time. 

Tasks can be saved to specific time-slots and saved using the save icon on the right. This information is written to local storage and will presist even if the page is refreshed. When tasks are saved a confirmation message is displayed on the page.

The tasks can be cleared by clicking the text at the bottom of the page.
