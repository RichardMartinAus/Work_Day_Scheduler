# Work Day Scheduler

## A simple, one page, day scheduler

The task was to create a single-page, simple, task manager app using starter code. The current day of the week and date is displayed at the top of the page using Moment.js. The day is broken down into 1 hour time slots starting at 9am and running up to 5pm. The past time-slots are grey in colour, the current time-slot is red and future time-slots are green. The blocks are coloured on refresh using Moment.js to retrieve the current time. 

Tasks can be saved to specific time-slots and saved using the save icon on the right. This information is written to local storage and will presist even if the page is refreshed. When tasks are saved a confirmation message is displayed on the page.

The tasks can be cleared by clicking the text at the bottom of the page.
